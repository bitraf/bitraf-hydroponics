TODO:
* Rearrange MOSFETs so they work as expected

QUESTIONS:
* Do we need the exra pins going to GND on rotary encoder and programing headers if we go for the jumper solution?

FEATURES:
* Fuse for power ports?

DONE:
* Added "0ohm" pull-up between VCC -> CH_PD
* Added 10k pull-up between GPIO2 -> 3.3v
* Added jumper connector to pull-down RESET and GPIO0 -> GND
